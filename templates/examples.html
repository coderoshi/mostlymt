<h3>Example Good Task Request</h3>
<blockquote>
  Call the Costco location closest to my address, and ask if
  they have Jasmine or Basmati rice. Email me the answer and the
  Costco address.
</blockquote>
<p class="pros">
  When you make a payment to MicroTasking, we receive your shipping address
  from Google<sup>TM</sup> Checkout. Much of the time, that is sufficient
  (If you require us to know another address, put it into your microtask).
