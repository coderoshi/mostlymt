<h3 id="definition">What is Microtasking?</h3>
<p>
	Microtasking (the concept) is the idea that you have better things to do with your 
	time than every little task which comes along.  It is the process of sourcing out
	small, well defined tasks and having them done remotely by someone else for a
	resonable fee.
</p>
<p>
	Microtasking<sup>sm</sup> (the company) is dedicated to facilitating the
	above concept by providing the lowest possible barrier to start.
</p>

<h3 id="how">How does it work?</h3>
<p>
	We believe that there is beauty in simplicity.  Simply provide us with a task that
	takes about an hour to complete, pay by credit card, and we'll take care of it.
