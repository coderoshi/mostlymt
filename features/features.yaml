# features.yaml
# 
# Defines features and the values and frequencies for those features.  If a given feature
# has exactly one value, then that will always be used.  For this reason, features are also
# immediately suitable for internationalization/localization purposes.
#
# This file also defines promotions - groupings of values which may differ from the default
# values for a promotionless visitor.
# 
# IMPORTANT: Changes to this file will not automatically be picked up by AppEngine.  In
# order to ensure that changes are applied, make sure at least one *.py file has changed.
# 
# NOTE: To test a particular value, simply comment out all other values and make sure to
# make at least one change to an *.py file as explained above.
